## What is Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)?

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a condition in which the kidneys are damaged and cannot filter blood as well as they should. This damage can cause wastes to build up in the body and lead to other health problems.

### Stages of CKD

CKD is classified into 5 stages based on the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR):

| Stage | GFR (mL/min/1.73m²) | Description |
|-------|---------------------|-------------|
| 1 | 90+ | Normal kidney function with evidence of kidney damage |
| 2 | 60-89 | Mildly reduced kidney function |
| 3a | 45-59 | Mildly to moderately reduced kidney function |
| 3b | 30-44 | Moderately to severely reduced kidney function |
| 4 | 15-29 | Severely reduced kidney function |
| 5 | <15 | Kidney failure (End-Stage Renal Disease) |

## Risk Factors for CKD

The main risk factors for developing CKD include:

1. **Diabetes**: The leading cause of CKD. High blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the kidneys.
2. **High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)**: The second leading cause of CKD. Uncontrolled high blood pressure damages kidneys over time.
3. **Family History**: Having a family member with kidney disease increases your risk.
4. **Age**: People over 60 are at higher risk.
5. **Obesity**: Excess weight puts strain on the kidneys.

## Symptoms of Kidney Disease

Early CKD often has no symptoms. As the disease progresses, symptoms may include:

- Fatigue and weakness
- Swelling in feet, ankles, or hands (edema)
- Shortness of breath
- Nausea and vomiting
- Loss of appetite
- Changes in urination (more or less frequent)
- Foamy or bubbly urine
- Blood in urine
- Difficulty sleeping
- Muscle cramps

## Diet Recommendations for Kidney Health

### Foods to Limit

1. **Sodium (Salt)**: Limit to 2,300 mg per day or less. Avoid processed foods, canned soups, and fast food.

2. **Potassium**: In advanced CKD, limit high-potassium foods:
   - Bananas, oranges, potatoes
   - Tomatoes, spinach
   - Dried fruits

3. **Phosphorus**: Limit phosphorus-rich foods:
   - Dairy products
   - Nuts and seeds
   - Processed meats
   - Cola drinks

4. **Protein**: Moderate protein intake as recommended by your doctor.

### Kidney-Friendly Foods

- **Fruits**: Apples, berries, grapes, pineapple
- **Vegetables**: Cabbage, cauliflower, bell peppers, onions
- **Proteins**: Skinless chicken, fish, egg whites
- **Grains**: White rice, white bread, pasta

## Dialysis Overview

When kidneys fail, dialysis performs the function of cleaning the blood.

### Types of Dialysis

1. **Hemodialysis**: Blood is filtered through a machine outside the body, typically 3 times per week for 3-4 hours.

2. **Peritoneal Dialysis**: Uses the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum) to filter blood inside the body. Can be done at home.

## Kidney Transplant

A kidney transplant is the best treatment for many patients with kidney failure. It offers:
- Better quality of life
- Fewer dietary restrictions
- No need for dialysis

### Types of Transplants

1. **Living Donor**: Kidney from a living person (family member or friend)
2. **Deceased Donor**: Kidney from someone who has died

## Medications Commonly Used

1. **Blood Pressure Medications**: ACE inhibitors, ARBs help protect kidneys
2. **Phosphate Binders**: Control phosphorus levels
3. **Erythropoietin (EPO)**: Treats anemia
4. **Vitamin D Supplements**: Maintain bone health
5. **Diuretics**: Help remove excess fluid

## Prevention Tips

1. Control blood sugar if diabetic
2. Keep blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg
3. Maintain a healthy weight
4. Exercise regularly (30 minutes, 5 days a week)
5. Don't smoke
6. Limit alcohol consumption
7. Stay hydrated with water
8. Get regular kidney function tests

## When to See a Doctor

Contact your healthcare provider if you notice:
- Persistent swelling
- Blood in urine
- Foamy urine
- Unexplained fatigue
- Changes in urination patterns
